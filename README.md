# PCA-Implementation
Description of Problem -  implement PCA on the Iris data set and use the result for classification. 
 
â€¢ Description of your Solution -
The accuracy with the one feature is calculated, then the eigen values along with PCA are calculated and the PCA is considered to classify the data.
This time the accuracy is quite high showing successful dimensionality reduction.

Output is as follows:

Step1: with 1D data:

Accuracy =
 0.6667
 0.6667
 0.60000
 0.86667
 0.66667
 0.80000
 0.93333
 0.66667
 0.73333
 0.66667
Average Accuarcy =0.726667

Step2 : calculating eigvalues

eigval =
   4.228242
   0.242671
   0.078210
   0.023835
